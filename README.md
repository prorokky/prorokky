# 👋 Hi, I'm Vlad Gaponov

Frontend developer with 4+ years of experience building complex web applications, analytical interfaces, and data-driven UI modules. Focused on performance, architecture, and clear engineering practices.

I work with modern JavaScript/TypeScript stacks, design scalable front-end modules, and mentor new engineers. I enjoy solving structural problems in UI architecture — from microfrontends to data-heavy visualizations.
